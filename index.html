          <p>
            <span>Naruto</span> is a Japanese manga series written and
            illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto
            Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and
            dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.
          </p>

          <p>
            His birth took place in a village called konoha(village hidden in
            the leaves). Throughout the naruto series we see him learning
            different jutsu and work really hard in order to become the hokage
            of Konoha.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naruto was born during a time of relative peace in an era of world
            history known as the "Shinobi World". The Shinobi World is separated
            by the division of five great Shinobi countries: powerful nations
            possessing powerful militaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wars are often fought between these five great nations but the world
            has no conventional weapons of war, as we would understand them.
            Instead battles are fought between ninjas, who are trained from a
            young age to harness their life force (or "chakra") to create
            attacks and illusions. Chakra is the driving force behind the whole
            naruto plot.
          </p>
          <div class="desc-image">
            <img src="./assets/images/home/narutoverse-map.jpg" alt="narutoverse-map" />
          </div>
          <p>
            All The five nations in the shinobi world are led by governmental
            leaders known as daimyō, who are in charge of ruling their
            individual nations solely through a monarch-like government. These
            countries are divided equally on an unknown continent to create
            balance in the Shinobi world. They are the Land of Earth in the
            Northwest, the Land of Lightning in the Northeast, the Land of Water
            in the East, the Land of Wind in the Southwest, and the Land of Fire
            in the centre.
          </p>
          <p>
            The countries are named after the dominant chakra nature of each of
            the areas. Each nation has ninja villages and each village have a
            kage(the highest representative of a village).
            Sounds interesting ! doesn't it ?
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, naruto is one of the most epic animes ever created and has a huge fanbase. The anime has a total of
            720 episodes and watching all of them is totally worth it(but skipping fillers is also a choice). What
            happens eventually in the series is upto you to find out. But i would say one thing that naruto becomes
            powerful and powerful means not only by his justu but also by his ability to understand and care about
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naruto has got epic plot, love,
            emotions, fights, friendships, betrayals and what not ! So, this was a bit of the backstory and if you
            haven't watched it yet then i would highly recommend you to do so. Now here lies the end of this backstory
            before
            you get the question <b>"Can he beat goku though ?"</b>
