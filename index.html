            Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
            Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who
            seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage,
            the leader of his village.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naruto was born during a time of relative peace in an era of world
            history known as the "Shinobi World."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Shinobi World is marked by the division of five great Shinobi
            countries: powerful nations who became as much via their military
            powers. Wars are occasionally fought between these five great powers
            but the world has no conventional weapons of war, as we would
            understand them. Instead battles are fought between ninjas, who are
            trained from a young age to harness their life force (or "chakra")
            to create attacks and illusions.
          </p>

          </div>
          <p>
            The five nations are led by governmental leaders known as daimyō,
            who are in charge of ruling their individual nations solely through
            a monarch-like government. These countries are divided equally on an
            unknown continent to create balance in the Shinobi world. They are
            the Land of Earth in the Northwest, the Land of Lightning in the
            Northeast, the Land of Water in the East, the Land of Wind in the
            Southwest, and the Land of Fire in the centre. The countries are
            named after the dominant chakra nature of each of the areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naruto was born in the Land of Fire and, as the show opens, we see
            him attempting to graduate from the Village Hidden in the Leaves'
            first level of ninja training.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Earth, humans didn't have chakra until Hamura and Hagoromo
            Ōtsutsuki were born with it, which was a result of their mother
            Kaguya eating their planet's chakra fruit from the God Tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wanting to be the only being in possession of such a power, Kaguya
            turned into a horrific beast called the ten Tails and attempted to
            kill her own sons. The two brothers were able to seal her away in
            one of their bodies and began teaching use of chakra to the rest of
            humanity through a practice called ninshū.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, Hamura departed to the moon in order to guard his mother's
            sealed remains, though not before receiving instructions from his
            brother to wait for a full millennium and observe mankind. There, he
            used the power of the Tenseigan to bring order and stability to the
            world of the Moon. Decades later and having grown elderly, Hamura
            passed away in bed surrounded by his clan members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two brothers intended to create peace by using the chakra to
            connect people's spiritual energy so that they would understand one
            another without even talking. However, the people did not use chakra
            in the way Hagoromo hoped, instead using it to connect their inner
            spiritual and physical energies. They kneaded their inner chakra to
            amplify and weaponise it, creating what is now known as ninjutsu.
          </p>
          <p>
            The newly empowered humans formed the aforementioned nations after
            hundreds of years of feudal wars. The conglomerated nations did not
            end all wars, though. As you might imagine, given that each nation's
            main concern is spitting out warriors, there were frequent battles
            between the great nations. Every so often this spilled over into a
            Great War between all five of the power players.
